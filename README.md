This was not created by me, this is a fork of https://github.com/nicholas477/SMAAPlugin.
This fork makes the plugin support UE 5.3 and fixes packaging errors on linux.

Original Description:

# SMAA Plugin
SMAA plugin for Unreal Engine 5.4+, copied from code from this PR: [Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Anti-Aliasing for UE5](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pull/11840/)

Turn off antialiasing with the command `r.AntiAliasingMethod 0` and then enable SMAA with the command `r.SMAA 1`
